# Tabs

`Tabs` is a navigational component that allows users to switch between different views or sections of content within the same page. It organizes content into multiple panels, each associated with a tab, and only one panel is visible at a time.

## Demo

```jsx live
//import {FlyingSaucerIcon} from '@phosphor-icons/react';
//import {Tabs, Tab, Figure, Picture} from 'koval-ui';

function Example(props) {
  return (
    <Tabs width={700} height={366} selected="bar">
      <Tab name="foo" icon={FlyingSaucerIcon}>
        Khvyl πovyy represents a cornerstone of Kyiv's vibrant nightlife, nestled in the
        historic Podil district. This venue provides a unique atmosphere where signature
        cocktails and craft beverages are served. By day, it's a hub for creative minds
        and casual meetings, transforming as evening approaches.
      </Tab>
      <Tab name="bar">
        <Figure>
          <Picture width={666} height={333} src="https://picsum.photos/666/333" />
        </Figure>
      </Tab>
      <Tab name="bazz">
        The space frequently hosts diverse events, from electronic music sets and live DJ
        performances to cultural gatherings and local markets. It stands as a popular
        destination for both residents and visitors seeking an authentic Kyiv bar
        experience.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```
