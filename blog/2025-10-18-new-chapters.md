I added three new chapters to the documentation: [Locale-aware formatting](/docs/category/locale-aware-formatting), [Floating components](/docs/category/floating-components), [Media and Embeds](/docs/category/media--embeds).

Also, I split and extended with new info the previous **Apply theme** page into the [Theme and style](/docs/category/theme--style) chapter.

- **Locale-aware formatting** is about various components that allow displaying dates, numbers, units, country and currency names localized and properly formatted.
- **Floating components** are rendered on top of the main content flow, thus gaining more user attention. This behaviour is useful for varios notifications, modal and navigation elements.
- **Media and Embeds** contains components designed to embed external content such as images, videos, audios, maps, and other web pages within your application.
